Mayor Ben, who usually appears at the beginnings and ends of each episode, calls the fans and viewers of the show Zoobaroos.Episodes were released on a wide array of VHS videocassettes, the most recent series released in 1997, but not yet released to DVD. In 2000, 14 new direct-to-video episodes and soundtracks were released, and the stage show \"Zoobilee Zoo Live!\" toured briefly, with several of the cast members reprising their roles.</p>",

This whole thing began in 1963, when Blake Edwards needed an opening sequence for his film, The Pink Panther, so he commissioned David H. DePatie and Warner Brothers cartoon director, Friz Freleng to make one for it. The opening sequence turned out to be more popular than the movie itself, so United Artist commissioned DePatie-Freleng Enterprises to make Pink Panther cartoons for theaters. In 1969, due to the success of the cartoon, NBC started airing The Pink Panther Show along with another DFE theatrical cartoon... The Inspector It was based on the Inspector Clouseau character. The Inspector was a clumsy French detective who bumbles everything up.</p>",

One of Spectrum's top agents is Captain Scarlet; once a Mysteron agent, Scarlet was able to throw off his conditioning and regain his sense of loyalty to Spectrum, with the added bonus that he is now indestructible.

Harcourt Brown fakes a message so that Conway Henderson believes the the American has been forced to crash-land on the planet's surface.

The crew is under command of Colonel Raeburn and his Venusian secretary Marla.</p><p>The series aired from April 7, 1963-June 11, 1964 in the UK and was sold overseas and broadcast in America, Canada and Australia, and in spite of its low budget, the show rated particularly high with young audiences in many regions. The show aired in America as Planet Patrol to avoid confusion with the 1952 series of the same name. The show garnered a large following, including Babylon 5 creator J.

No-one knows how they came to live on the island but they naturally came to live together in the village situated in the little valley where the sunshine is warmest and the cold wind is the least harsh. In the village lives Pororo, a very curious impish little penguin, the good-natured polar bear Poby, the smug nosy red fox Eddy, the shy and timid little beaver Loopy, the cheerful penguin girl Petty and the happy humming bird, Harry . All of our friends have distinct personalities and different interests which sometimes cause little (and sometimes not so little) rifts in their calm white world. But they are all good friends and know how to help each other in times of trouble.</p>",

Two teams compete to win cash and prizes by answering trivia questions and completing messy stunts known as \"physical challenges\". Each team consisted of two children. Originally, both teams wore red uniforms, but after Double Dare entered syndication in 1988, one team wore blue uniforms while the other wore red (Finders Keepers, a Nickelodeon game show that premiered one year after Double Dare, played a role in this change). Each team received their own name (except for on the original Fox version of Family Double Dare, in which the teams were simply designated by the families' respective last names). Even though this was the case, the host usually called both teams \"The Red Team\" and \"The Blue Team\".</p>",

Unlike the original Flintstones series and its several spin-off productions featuring the kids and their famous parents, this show focused more on educational values and lessons for children.</p>",

Every episode of the series featured a different organ or system within the human body (like the brain, the heart, the circulatory system, etc.).</p>",

Well, not if you tell the true stories which is exactly what HAHN FILM intends to do with the production of this CGI TV series. HAHN FILM exposes the truth about these wondrous fables through the real protagonist - Sherazade and her genie of the lamp, Halil. Without this feisty woman, the adventures of Aladin, Ali Baba or even Sinbad the famous sailor would have been just another long forgotten camp fire yarn. </p>",

The series follows the adventures of Ruff, a smart and steadfast cat, and Reddy, a good-natured and brave (but not overly bright) dog. The series also was presented by Screen Gems, the television arm of Columbia Pictures (now Sony Pictures Television). <i>Ruff and Reddy</i> premiered in December 1957 and ran for fifty episodes until April 1960, comprising three seasons. Hanna and Barbera created the series as the first of their fledgling television operation, first named H-B Enterprises. The \"buddy\" theme had previously been explored in their <i>Tom and Jerry</i> theatrical shorts, but unlike Tom and Jerry, Ruff and Reddy are not adversaries, but housemates and best friends. The series is notable as one of the earliest original animated television programs, and a pioneering use of limited animation techniques.</p>",

The series first aired on February 12, 2014 with a new episode of <i>Teen Titans Go!</i>. The Lego Group and Cartoon Network Studios produced the series together with the help of world class animators, voice actors, and toy designers. The series revolves around the Mixels, small creatures that can mix and combine with one another in creative and unpredictable storylines. Although previous Lego series, such as <i>Lego Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu</i> and <i>Legends of Chima</i>, use CGI animation, Mixels made use of Toon Boom Harmony software, animated at Atomic Cartoons, Inc., before later being animated traditionally at Digital eMation, Inc.</p><p>A mobile app was released for the series on March 4, 2014, named <i>Calling All Mixels</i>, and even earlier two websites, one on the LEGO website and another owned by Cartoon Network, were launched where fans can learn about the Mixels. Seven series of collectible Lego building toys have currently been released, based on the characters. An eighth and ninth series are also going to be released. On February 19, 2014, the series began airing as an interstitial program on Boomerang, and still currently airs as such.</p>",

The Muppet portions of the show focused on the interactions between Ace Hart and his animator Eliot Shag (who, like Ace, is a German Shepherd). Eliot would illustrate the stories while Ace would go traverse through it, occasionally breaking the fourth wall to speak with Eliot about the various troubles with the story. In one episode, Eliot even enters Dog City himself to join Ace in solving a mystery. A recurring gag was that many of the characters in the cartoon were seemingly based on the residents of Eliot's apartment building. The bulldog crime-boss Bugsy Vile was inspired by the building's grouchy bulldog superintendent Bruno. Ace's love interest Rosie was based on Eliot's unrequited feelings for his neighbor Colleen, and so on. The Muppet characters were unaware of this.</p>",

The plot involved a little girl's Raggedy Ann &amp; Andy dolls that would come to life when no humans were present in her bedroom, and they would be whisked off to a parallel world to save its inhabitants from the villain, an evil but inept sorcerer known as Cracklin. Also aiding Ann and Andy were two of the little girl's other stuffed animals, a panda with a faux-British accent known as Grouchy Bear and a stuffed rabbit known as Sunny Bunny. Sometimes they would be joined by more modern toys such as robots or toy soldiers. Often the plot involved the toys helping children in such places as Ancient Egypt or a Native American tribe.</p>",

These characters are so small that to them flowers and blades of grass seem like mighty trees. Each episode combines situations that will be familiar to small children (including playing games, snowy days, holidays, birthdays, bathtime) with the magical elements that are part of everyday life for fairies and elves.</p><p>The stories revolve around the daily lives of Holly, a tiny five-year-old fairy princess and her best friend Ben, an elf of the same age. Because Holly is a young fairy she is still learning how to do magic properly and her spells often don't work out quite as planned. She also has quite a bit to learn about flying and mostly flutters close to the ground.</p><p>Ben is a young elf. Elves can't do magic and they don't have wings. But elves are very brave, can run fast and are very good at making things ΓÇô especially toys. Ben is extremely proud of being elf.</p>",

Bagpuss is a cat who spends his time slumbering in a shop owned by Emily. The shop itself doesn't sell anything, and Emily seems a little young to be a shopkeeper - it is a most unusual shop, after all. Each week Emily brings Bagpuss objects to mend and repair. Bagpuss will wake up and examine them, in the company of his friends - including Madeleine the rag doll, and the mice from the Marvellous Mechanical Mouse Organ. All this happens under the watchful eye of Professor Yaffle, the carved woodpecker book end, who comments scathingly on the toys and the stories they tell. Then at some point, Bagpuss becomes very very tired, and they all go back to sleep. That's basically it, so why did this all happen? Simp...</p>",

A boy named Malysh (\"A Little One\") suffers from solitude being the youngest of the three children in a Swedish family. The acute sense of solitude makes him desperately want a dog, but before he gets one, he \"invents\" a friend - the very Karlson who lives upon the roof. So typical for the Russian culture spirit of mischief, which is, actually, never punished, and the notion that relative welfare not necessarily means happiness made the book by Astrid Lindgren and its TV adaptations tremendously popular in the Soviet Union and nowadays Russia and vice versa - somewhat alienated to the Western reader and viewer (see User's comments below). However, both the book and the cartoon are truly universal - entertaining and funny for the children and thought-provoking and somewhat sad for grownups.</p>",

The first series of thirteen 15-minute episodes was produced by Woodland Animations and broadcast by the BBC in 1981. Ivor Wood, a vetaran of animations like The Magic Roundabout, was at the helm as producer. Ken Barrie sang the well known theme tune and provided the narration. The stories were very successful and have seen endless repeats over the years. To celebrate the 10th anniversary of the show in 1991, the old production crew was reunited for two one-off 25 minute specials, again shown by the BBC. Two more came in 1995, and these were followed by a second full series of 13 adventures. Then, after almost 10 years of absence from our screens, Postman Pat returned in 2004 for his third series.</p>",

It is filmed in the United States and was created by sisters Emilie Brown and Rachel Coleman, the latter of whom hosts the series. Between the years 2006 and 2008, it was aired by American Public Television in many cities across the US. <i>Signing Time!</i> is produced and distributed by Two Little Hands Productions, which is located in Salt Lake City, Utah. <i>Signing Time's</i> multi-sensory approach encourages learning through three senses ΓÇö visual, auditory and kinesthetic ΓÇö and reaches children with diverse learning styles and abilities by encouraging interaction through signing, singing, speaking and dancing. Throughout the series, Coleman, her daughter Leah, Leah's cousin Alex, and Hopkins, an animated frog, teach ASL vocabulary-building signs. The series teaches signs for common words, questions, phrases, movements, colors, sports, days of the week, everyday objects, and common activities.</p>",

The show was inspired by the French books of Sylvie de Mathuisieulx and Sebastien Diologent that are about a 11 year-old kid that has adventures his his two friends. A 12 year-old child that is always conccocting plans. Angelo is a very intelligent boy, being able to make up many, many plans for everything that works in one way or another. They are always a challenge, but he and his friends always put things right. Angelo has a 15 year-old sister named Elena, and a 5 year-old brother named Peter. It has been implied that Angelo and his friend Lola have some kind of relationship. Proof is that whenever one of them is caught trying to impress another boy/girl, the other would interrupt.</p>",

An army of the monsters, led by a powerful warrior named Morticon, swarmed into the land with their sights set on taking over the magical realm, the human realm and beyond, but they would have to combat a legion of brave and powerful wizards. The Mystics battled valiantly against overwhelming odds until they drove the evil back from the edge of the human world. The strongest wizard of all, Leanbow, cast a spell and sent the evil warriors into the Underworld, having the Gatekeeper seal the gates for all eternity. The forces of truth successfully thwarted the dark forces' attempt to take the surface world, but they lost Leanbow, as he made sure the evil forces did not escape by sealing himself on their side of the Gate. The human world would never know of the Great Battle, nor of the sacrifices made to spare their lives from destruction.

    "summary": "<p>An animated series based on the movie of the same name. Marty, Doc Brown, Jules and Verne travel through time in the Doctor's modified DeLorean, bouncing from one era to the next where a different adventure awaits them each time. Between shows there are live-action segments featuring Christopher Lloyd as Doc Brown with Bill Nye the Science Guy.</p><p>Following the conclusion of the third movie, Doc Brown settled in 1991 in Hill Valley with his new wife Clara, their sons Jules and Verne, and the family dog, Einstein. As with the films, time travel was achieved through the use of a modified DeLorean, which had apparently been re-built after it was destroyed at the end of the trilogy The DeLorean now has voice-activated \"time circuits\" and can also travel instantaneously to different locations in space and time, in addition to folding into a suitcase. The characters also travelled through time using the steam engine time machine Doc invented at the end of Back to the Future Part III.</p><p>Although Jennifer Parker made occasional appearances, the show focused primarily on Marty and the Brown family, whereas the movies focused on the McFly family. The film's villain, Biff Tannen, also appeared from time to time. In addition, relatives of both the McFly and Tannen families were plentiful in the past or future parallel time zones visited. Unlike the films, which took place entirely in Hill Valley and the surrounding area, the series frequently took the characters to exotic locations.</p><p>At the end of every episode, Doc Brown would appear to do an experiment, often related to the episode's plot. The first season also included post-credits segments with Biff Tannen telling a joke related to the episode, possibly alluding to Thomas F. Wilson's career as a stand-up comedian.</p>",

    "summary": "<p><b>Tiswas</b> (\"Today Is Saturday Watch And Smile\") was a Saturday morning children's British television series which ran from 5 January 1974 to 3 April 1982 and was produced for the ITV network by ATV Network Limited.</p><p>It was created by ATV continuity announcer Peter Tomlinson following a test period in 1973 when he tried out a few competitions and daft stuff between the programmes.</p><p>Most famously hosted by Chris Tarrant between 1974 and 1981, and later Sally James, it also featured the young Lenny Henry and occasionally Jim Davidson together with Bob Carolgees and his puppet, Spit the Dog. John Gorman, former member of 1960s cult band The Scaffold, was also a presenter. On the programme, Birmingham folk-singer and comedian Jasper Carrott was to introduce the nation to the \"Dying Fly Dance\" and also to many local hospital casualty wards as the dance at one point soared high in the RoSPA list of common causes of household injury. Like its cleaner BBC counterpart, <i>Multi-Coloured Swap Shop</i>, it had a running order but no script (with the exception of some specific sketches). The programme was broadcast from Studio 3 at ATV Centre in Birmingham; this was the weekday home for the company's regional news magazine, <i>ATV Today</i>.</p><p>The show was a stitch-together of competitions, film clips and pop promos, just about held together by sketches and links from the cast. The show also regularly featured spoofs of BBC children's programming.</p><p>A feature of <i>Tiswas</i> was 'The Cage' wherein initially the child audience, and later their parents, were confined and periodically doused in water (one spin-off of the series was the hit <i>The Bucket of Water Song</i>, performed by the Four Bucketeers), whilst the series was also frequently visited by the Phantom Flan Flinger, who would throw flans around the studio at all and sundry. Both Tarrant and the Flan Flinger would take great delight in trying to 'flan' cameramen who would go to great lengths to avoid being hit.</p>",

Wenda is a \"roll-up-your-sleeves\" kind of girl with a heart as huge as a hippo, and a strong sense of adventure. But her overconfidence often, hilariously, gets her and the gang into trouble. No matter where Wenda wanders, she always seems to find herself mixed up in the middle of mayhem! BUT when the going gets tough, she just uses her words... literally! With some quick wordplay she always manages to get out of even the trickiest situations. Along for the adventures are Wesley Woodchuck and a bookish boy named Wu.</p><p>Together, the three friends share in the daring exploits of each new travel destination and with a little teamwork (and by playing with words, sounds and letters), there's nothing they can't overcome!</p>",

They trick him into going on a \"secret mission\" to an obscure planet at the edge of the universe, a planet with the unlikely name of Earth, in hopes that he'll die along the way. But their trick backfires when ZIM safely reaches Earth and begins his ever-so-subtle conquest of it.

    "summary": "<p><b>Watch with Mother</b> was a cycle of children's programs broadcast by BBC Television from 1950 until 1974, it was the first BBC television series aimed specifically at pre-school children. In accordance with its target it was initially broadcast between 3:45 pm and 4:00 pm, before the older children came home from school. Although Andy Pandy had been regularly broadcast since mid-1952, joined by the Flower Pot Men later that year, the name <i>Watch with Mother</i> was not adopted until 1952, when the programming was expanded to three afternoons a week with the addition of Rag, Tag and Bobtail. The \"classic\" cycle of shows was in place by September 1955, with the first showing of The Woodentops, and included:- Picture Book (Mondays from 1955), Andy Pandy (Tuesdays from 1950), Flower Pot Men (Wednesdays from 1952), Rag, Tag and Bobtail (Thursdays from 1953), and The Woodentops (Fridays from 1955).</p>",

    "summary": "<p><b>Why Don't You?</b> or (Why Don't You Just Switch Off Your Television Set and Go Out and Do Something Less Boring Instead?) was a BBC children's television series broadcast in 42 series between 20 August 1973 and 21 April 1995.</p><p>It originally went out in the morning during the Summer school holidays and once was shown during the weekday evening children's TV slot around 4:45 to 5:45. Later it went out during the Easter and Christmas school holidays although it was also broadcast once on Saturday mornings. The format consisted of groups or \"gangs\" of children responding to letters from viewers who wrote into the show suggesting games, 'makes' and days out. Typically these were arts-and-crafts activities involving cutting up paper, or games and magic tricks children could learn to impress their friends.</p><p>Created by producer/director Patrick Dowling at the BBC's Bristol studios, Russell T Davies was later at one time a producer and director for Why Don't You...? before going on to greater fame as writer of Queer as Folk and producer of the 2005 revival of Doctor Who. Under Davies's direction, the format of the series shifted from magazine show to drama, with plots frequently centring around harebrained young Welsh presenter Ben Slade and his increasingly elaborate inventions. Slade was one of the longest serving presenters in the show's 22-year run.</p>",

    "summary": "<p><b>Kid 'n Play</b> is an American hip-hop act from New York City that was popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The duo was composed of Christopher \"Kid\" Reid (April 5, 1964) and Christopher \"Play\" Martin (July 10, 1962) working alongside their DJ, Mark \"DJ Wiz\" Eastmond. Besides their successful musical careers, they are also notable for branching out into acting. Kid 'n Play had their own NBC Saturday morning cartoon, <i>Kid 'n Play</i>, for one season from 1990 to 1991. On the show, Kid 'n Play were regressed to teenagers, but their recording careers remained intact, as did their comic personas. The real Kid 'n Play appeared in live-action wraparounds of the cartoons, but voice actors (again including close friend, Martin Lawrence) performed in the animated portions of the show. The show stressed positive role models, teaching kids how to get along and stay out of trouble. A 1992 Marvel Comics comic book based on the cartoon lasted nine issues. They also shot some segments for the PBS math show <i>Square One TV</i> and <i>Sesame Street</i>.</p>",

While the initial meeting was less than pleasant, events soon have them, along with a newly hired nanny, her daughter and Scrooge's stupid but skilled pilot, on countless adventures as the group goes around the world looking for treasure, or defending Scrooge's current assets from enemies like the Beagle Boys or Magica De Spell.</p>",

Premiering Wednesday April 9 at 5:30 p.m. (ET/PT) on Cartoon Network, The Tom and Jerry Show is a fresh take on the iconic frenemies that preserves the look, core characters and sensibilities of the original theatrical shorts. Comprised of two 11-minute elements, each episode will feature Tom the cat and Jerry the mouse plotting against each other-with Tom's determination matched only by Jerry's own cleverness in evading capture. But this time the cartoon mayhem will not be limited to only Tom and Jerry's familiar suburban setting. In The Tom and Jerry Show, the title characters' nonstop game of cat and mouse will expand to also include more fantastic worlds, from a witch's cabin to a mad scientist's lab.</p>",

The Wuzzles features a variety of short, rounded animal characters (each called a Wuzzle, which means to mix up). Each is a roughly even, and colorful, mix of two different animal species (as the theme song mentions, \"...livin' with a split personality\"), and all the characters sport wings on their backs, although only Bumblelion and Butterbear are seemingly capable of flight. All of the Wuzzles live on the Isle of Wuz. Double species are not limited to the Wuzzles themselves. From the appleberries they eat to the telephonograph in the home, or a luxury home called a castlescraper, nearly everything on Wuz is mixed together in the same way the Wuzzles are. The characters in the show were marketed extensively.</p>",

He can instantaneously make his clothes change to something else, a body part change shape, pull anything out of his pockets, etc. Whenever Ipkiss is wearing the mask, there are no rules. For those who believe that comedian Jim Carrey is actually a cartoon disguised in human form, the 1995-1997 cartoon season offered abundant evidence. Three of Carrey's starring vehicles were adapted to the small screen: Dumb and Dumber, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, and The Mask. Of the three, The Mask was probably the most obvious choice for adaptation. The feature film was a digitally-enhanced human cartoon, based on the Dark Horse comic book.</p>",

    "summary": "<p><b>Pob's Programme</b> is a children's television programme, which was broadcast in the United Kingdom on Channel 4 between October 1986 and November 1987. The programme is presented by a puppet named Pob (played by puppeteer Robin Stevens), who speaks a primitive version of English and who supposedly lives inside the viewer's TV (the casing and red, green and blue electron guns visible behind him). The opening titles of the show consist of the character breathing on the camera lens (this breathing was often mistaken for spitting, given the loud noise accompanying it and the thick condensation appearing on screen), and tracing his name in the condensation. Each week on the programme, a celebrity guest visits Pob's garden, and entertains him ΓÇö though Pob and the guest never appear on screen together.</p>",

Everyone has long known that it is easier for kids to learn a foreign language if the lesson is built in the form of a game, when all the child's attention is focused on what is happening.

In this project, a children's language telecourse, a game and an exciting adventure, which help make learning English easy, fun and entertaining, have been wonderful combined.</p>",

Michelle has always dreamed of becoming a PINY girl. And then she gets a scholarship, completely out of the blue. Her greatest wish is about to come true. But dreams are not always a bed of roses: Michelle's humble origins and her innate talent for fashion make her a major rival for PINY's \"mean girls\", the Beautiful People. This rivalry sparks off on the very first day of class, totally by chance, and Michelle finds herself being welcomed into PINY's alternative clique: the Indie Chic girls. Just before the course begins, her father reveals to her that she was adopted. But an even bigger surprise lies in store, and as the episodes progress, she will finally discover something that the viewers knew all along: she has a sister and they go to the same school.</p>",

Young hero Col. James \"Dash\" Derringer, an ace Starcom pilot, was the star of the series, and several of his teammates were family members. He was also backed up by the resourceful ace pilot John \"Slim\" Griffin, whose niece was yet another Starcom pilot. Other heroes on the Starcom side included Col. Paul \"Crowbar\" Corbin and Admiral Franklin Brinkley. The show had very high quality production, with top notch animation and relatively mature subject matter and dialog. Together, the members of Starcom fought Dark's legions of robotic minions, flying into battle in a fleet of advanced spacecraft.</p>",

The rescue helicopter Helinor is a touch little gal who's good at straightening things out. And far out by the open seas stands the lighthouse Big Blinky who's been there as long as anyone can remember.

    "summary": "<p>King Rollo was a children's character created by David McKee in 1979, starring in a series of books, animations (narrated by Ray Brooks), and a comic strip in the magazine Buttons. In all, thirteen episodes of the animation were produced in 1980 (shown in two halves), by McKee's own King Rollo Films, and originally shown as part of the pre-school 'See-Saw' strand. The central character of the stories was Rollo himself, a child-like King who was always in need of advice and assistance from his friends. Among these were The Magician (a father figure) Cook (the king's cook, a mother figure, who was arguably the real ruler of the kingdom); his neighbour, Queen Gwen; King Frank; and perhaps most importantly, Rollo's cat, Hamlet, who was generally portrayed as wiser than Rollo himself. The animations used the same distinctive colourful cut-out paper look as McKee's other works, such as Mr Benn, and one memorable aspect was that the characters' legs would rotate outwards when walking until they were at right-angles at the sides of their body.</p>",

This series was broken up into different segments: The Adventures of Popeye, Popeye's Treasure Hunt, Popeye's Sports Parade, and Dinky Dog. The latter segment starred a huge mutt and had little or nothing to do with Popeye or any sort of maritime activity. Because of the changing times, these episodes featured less fighting and more trickery on the part of Popeye's nemesis, who was back to being called Bluto after his mysterious name-switching run as \"Brutus\". Each episode also featured a public service portion, in which the spinach-eating swabby would educate his nephews Peepeye, Pupeye, and Pipeye on topics such as home safety or sensible dieting.</p>",

    "summary": "<p><b>Ну, погоди!</b> (literal English translation: Just you wait!) is a cartoon series about two anthropomorphic animals named Volk (Wolf) and Zayats (Hare). The plot slightly resembles that of Tom and Jerry or The Road Runner Show; the director (Vyacheslav Kotyonochkin) has admitted that he was learning from the USA animated series. However, in <i>Ну, погоди!</i> you won't see that \"toonish\" humor that deals with pies in the face, anvils, mallets and dynamite. This series is less violent than its American prototypes and has softer, more intellectual humor.</p><p>The \"classical\" 16 episodes were produced at the Soyuzmultfilm studio in Moscow between 1969 and 1986. The series was cancelled soon after the death of Anatoly Papanov (voice of Volk). In 1993 the studio attempted to revive the series using Papanov's old voice samples; two more episodes were produced this way. In 2005 Christmas Films studio announced the production of new episodes; Volk and Zayats will be voiced by other actors.</p>",

    "summary": "<p>When you give a mouse a cookie, he'll probably ask for a glass of milk, and thenΓÇª who knows what he'll ask for next? <b>If You Give a Mouse a Cookie</b> follows the adventures of Mouse, Oliver and other familiar friends as they discover that when you've got a curious Mouse for a friend (not to mention a Moose, a Pig, a Cat and a Dog), one thing always leads to another, then another, and then another! You never know what to expect, but you do know it's going to be fun - and maybe a little bit messy. Much like the books, the story will start in one place and lead to unexpectedly delightful twists and turns until we are back at home where we started.</p>",

    "summary": "<p>Gadget has been promoted to the rank of Lieutenant and recruited by the World Organization of Mega Powers (WOMP), an elite international peacekeeping organization whose goal is to defend humankind from the world's most menacing villains. That may sound like a daunting task, but with the help of some new zany gadgets and a new set of assistants: the Gadgetinis - a team of pint-sized robotic versions of Inspector Gadget who are frequently the unintended victims of his bumbling, Gadget is still up to the task. Just like the old days, Gadget still gets help from his brainy 12-year-old niece, Penny, whether he likes it or not. Penny created the Gadgetinis two plucky teenage robots, the responsible Digit and the mischievous Fidget, to help her uncle, since Brain has now retired from active duty. Agent Fidget and Agent Digit, as Gadget likes to call them, form a comical tandem with their different personalities. Now under the control of Colonel Nozzaire, Lieutenant Gadget must battle long time nemisis Dr. Claw, along with a slew of new baddies, such as villainous mutant monsters and power-hungry space aliens. But in the end, thanks to his heart of gold, his indefatigable spirit and a little help from his brilliant niece Penny, Gadget always manages to save the day. But not without a good bit of property destruction along the way. It seems some things never change.</p>",

The series educates, maintains and encourages children to increase their understanding of various fields such as chemistry, music, mathematics and many more through 24 different experiments.</p><p>We will follow the two winners of the Nordic region's premier inventory competition for children. The prize includes a visit to a true inventor: Professor Primus. The professor is now a failed figure who has not had any success since winning the competition a long time ago. The professor therefore becomes mad at jealousy on the children's creativity and locks them in their lab.</p><p>The big question is - will they come home to their families before Christmas? The only way out is to solve the difficult experiments of the professor. Every day, they must try to solve a new experiment; they are able to open a door that hopefully leads to freedom.</p><p>The series is recorded at Tekniska Museet in Stockholm. All the experimentally excited children can be exhibited and let the exploration luster sprout from 26 December.</p>",

These adventures marked the animation debut of Superboy, as well as his teenage alter ego Clark Kent, who acted as the bespectacled, mild-mannered disguise for the young hero, Lana Lang, and Krypto the super-powered dog who would accompany his master on every dangerous mission. Other characters such as Pa and Ma Kent, foster parents of the Boy of Steel, and the town of Smallville were also faithfully recreated from comic book adventures. As a result of the production's budget, the show featured a great amount of stock animation as well as limited movement from the characters.</p><p>Each episode featured the Boy of Steel ducking out of high school and racing into action to battle a wide array of adversaries, from dognappers in \"Krypto, K-9 Detective,\" androids run amok in \"The Revolt of Robotville,\" and alien menaces in \"The Spy from Outer Space,\" to another young hero with similar powers in \"Superboy Meets Mighty Lad,\" and a slew of otherworldly monsters (\"The Deep Sea Dragon,\" \"Visitor from the Earth's Core\"). He even wound up being captured and successfully having to fight a gang of small-time crooksΓÇöall while in his disguise as Clark KentΓÇöin \"The Gorilla Gang.\" Most of the stories were written by DC writers such as Bob Haney and George Kashdan, while character designs were based closely upon the Superboy comic books of the time.</p>",

However, instead of landing in rural Kansas and being raised to believe in American values, his rocket ship crashes into a Ukrainian farm. The young hero grows up in Russia and becomes the champion of the common worker, fighting on the side of socialism during Stalin's reign. What begins as one small shift in trajectory results in massive changes for the world, as the most powerful man alive no longer belongs to the United States of America. As time passes, Superman becomes more involved in Russia's politics, using his reputation to influence international governments.</p>",

The series was about a boy named Sam Baxter (R.J. Williams) and his robot D.E.C.K.S. (voiced by Rob Paulsen; built from old audio/video equipment and a Sony U-Matic videotape head; an acronym for Digital Electronic Cassette-Headed Kinematic System) and their adventures in the basement, which has a time machine that can bring back historical figures. After a short live-action skit, D.E.C.K.S. would turn on the television screen on his torso and display an animated short. There are two new Hanna-Barbera series made exclusively for this program. The Fender Bender 500 and Monster Tails.</p>",

He was created by mad scientist Professor Montgomery Weirdo and his assistant Count Kook, who lived in a haunted house on Horror Hill. Milton is a smiling, good-natured fellow, thanks to the Professor using too much \"tincture of tenderness\". Milton was created not of individual body parts, but rather in a mold from such liquids as \"essence of terror\" and \"sinister sauce.\" Out of fear of his creation destroying him, Professor Weirdo intended to add just a few drops of the aforementioned tincture of tenderness to the mold, but Count Kook bumped the Professor's elbow, resulting in too much of the tincture being added to the mix.</p>",

What if they had to memorize the entire U.S. highway system, do mind-bending math equations or spell incredibly complex words - backwards - all on their own? What if they had to do this against the clock? The talented \"Genius Junior\" cast members will tackle these and other challenging scenarios.</p><p>Over four rounds, with each round tougher than the last, teams of three will have to work together to beat the competition. Each episode's winning team will then get to take on The Cortex - the toughest test of smarts on the planet - to build up their prize fund. It's not enough to win a spelling bee, be a mathlete or even a memory champion. To win \"Genius Junior\", you have to be brilliant at everything. The winning team will take home a \"Genius Junior\" grant that will set the stage for a big and bright future that lies ahead.</p>",

    "summary": "<p><b>Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle</b> was a Filmation cartoon that aired on CBS from 1976 to 1980. Unlike the simple-minded man depicted in the movies, this cartoon had an intelligent, well-spoken Tarzan who was accompanied by a monkey sidekick, N'kima. In many ways, this series was the most faithful of all screen-based adaptations of Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan, and featured a number of \"lost cities\" from the original novels. The rotoscoped animation is based upon the work of Burrough's favorite Tarzan artist, Burne Hogarth.</p>",

Ok, maybe solving mysteries isn't really her JOB; technically, she's a police special assistant, which is an official-sounding name for a trainee.

It follows the trails and exploits of a South Korean girl named Pucca who is insanely in love with a prideful ninja named Garu. Meanwhile, Garu and Pucca help their town of Sooga Village out when evil ninjas attack, as well as diffuse a lot of the absurd situations that frequently plague the town. This show could best be described as a cleaned-up version of South Park meets Looney Tunes meets Naruto. There is some very subtly hidden adult humor; but most of the adult jokes would not go noticed by small children, who are the primary audience.</p>",

This show opened with Macaulay in a live-action appearance in which he explained the show's premise. Nick McClary (Culkin) owned a magic baseball glove which, if punched three times, granted his every wish he desired. The only catch was that the glove could be used just once per week. Stories revolved around Nick's wishes and the trouble that usually followed. Nick's best friend was Darryl, the only one in on the glove's secrets and usually became involved in the adventures. Nick was frequently harassed by Frankie Dutweiler, the neighborhood bully; other characters included neighbor Mrs. Opal, Nick's Mom and Dad and his baby sister, Katie.</p>",

The animals generally dismiss the gift, and usually \ncapture ApeTrully who calls for help from First Squad. Members of First \nSquad (usually everyone except Mr. No Hands, who does come along on \noccasion) deploy by descending through a maze of tubes and landing on \nturtles fitted with tank treads, and then are launched through a tunnel \nand out over the water. When they arrive where ApeTrully is being held, a\n battle or contest ensues, during which special talents or abilities of \nthe animals are revealed, often something based on their nature. After \nthe battle or contest, the animals usually concede to First Squad's \nskills saying through translation by ApeTruly (unless the animal rulers\n can talk) that they would be honored to join Big Green. After joining, \nthe animals often are assigned a particular duty at Big Green based on \ntheir demonstrated skills, which may help solve a problem introduced in a\n subplot.</p><p>The show is very loosely based on ancient Chinese novel the Water Margin focusing on the exploits of First Squad and Second Squad.</p>",

Dom DeLuise, starred as the main character of the Pizzeria setting for the show's main action. The spirited half hour never achieved the wide-spread success of the earlier PBS hit <i>Lamb Chop's Play-Along!</i>, but was a favorite of Shari Lewis' fans, of all ages, and was likely to have enjoyed a long and healthy run if it had not been for Lewis' tragic illness.</p>",

    "summary": "<p>Ricochet Rabbit worked as a sheriff in a Western setting called Hoop 'n' Holler. Ricochet, true to his name, would bounce off all the walls yelling \"bing-bing-bing!\" His deputy Droop-A-Long Coyote was never able to be as \"jumpy\" and would end up crashing through a window, or some similar accident except on one occasion when Ricochet and Droop-A-Long were running away from a bear. Unfortunately for both of them, the bear also managed to bounce off. In addition to his speed, Ricochet was known for using trick bullets against his opponents (for example, a bullet that would stop in mid-flight and hover while striking the bad guy with an impossibly over-sized mallet, or exploding after inside bigger compartments of the bullet). Ricochet Rabbit's catchphrase consisted of three quick bings; \"bing, bing, BING!\", followed by him referring to himself in the third person; \"Ricochet Rabbit!\"</p>",

The aim of Inside Life is to present this information in a way that is simple for children to understand. Each of the ten Inside Life programmes follows a lucky child as they accompany the Life filmmakers on expeditions around the world with the aim of capturing groundbreaking wildlife footage. The series is aimed at 7-9 year olds.</p><p>In each 30-minute programme, the presenter first sets out on a fact-finding assignment in the UK to discover more about the animal they will be filming, before joining the Natural History Unit's expedition team to try and film the species in the wild.</p><p>A hardback book, Inside Life by Doug Hope and Vanessa Coates was published 2 October 2009 to accompany the series. It is presented in the style of a scrapbook and gives an insight into the programme's creation, as well as providing educational material about the animals featured in the series.</p>",

One day, Sally teleports to the \"mid world\" (Earth), where she uses her magic to fend off a couple of burglars menacing two young schoolgirls. Immediately befriended by her new acquaintances - tomboyish Yoshiko Hanamura (known affectionately as \"Yotchan\") and girly Sumire Kasugano - Sally decides to stay on indefinitely, leading to various kinds of shōjo mischief in the best Japanese tradition. As with Samantha Stevens in Bewitched, Sally tries to keep her supernatural abilities secret, assuming the role of a human child.</p>",

When her wealthy father dies, remaining debts leave Chitose almost broke, and she is kicked out of the affluent Tokai no Gakuen, or City Academy. She is left with nothing in the world but the clothes on her back and one pink goldfish named Gyopi-chan, the only memento she has of her father. Wandering lost, she collapses on the grounds of the poor-but-happy Inaka no Chugakko (Country Jr. High School), where the students are rough if friendly, and farm animals regularly roam the school grounds and even attend class. Recovering, she enters into the school but is repelled by its air of poverty, to which she is unaccustomed.</p>",

It is about a vampire duck that, due to a mishap during the re-animation process, is now a vegetarian. He uses a special machine in his castle to transport it to different places in search of treasure, money, and fame as a musician. He is accompanied by Igor, the family butler, who is a believer in the Old Ways of being a vampire. He is disappointed that the Count is not as evil as the old Count used to be. Also in the castle is Nanny, the nursemaid. She is big and dimwitted. Duckula is constantly being hunted by Dr. Von Goosewing, a vampire hunter.</p>",

Imagine that you're an alien from outer space. You've left behind your boring, conformist dimension known as Conforma and traveled across time, space and other dimensions to arrive at planet earth, and then land in a little out-of-the-way seaside town called DeSpray Bay. More specifically, Tommy Cadle's lighthouse hideaway. That's right! Pet Aliens have crashed into the top of the lighthouse tower and made themselves at home. Unfortunately, the earth boy living there was none-too-keen on this house invasion. When Tommy woke to be greeted by a big, slobbering Gumpers, he did what any kid would do when faced with being devoured by a pink, fuzzy, lovable alien: he ran and fell off the top of his lighthouse!</p>",

The show featured Hart and the animated Plasticine character Morph, and other characters created by David Sproxton like 'Smoulder the Moulder', which was a lump of mould which would create props by 'spraying' them out of a spray can. The only other human to appear on a regular basis was Mr Bennett, the caretaker, played by Colin Bennett. The programme won a BAFTA award for Hart in 1984.</p>",

They face the dreaded Captain Blackheart and his dangerous, seductive new First Mate, Lily and a band of fierce pirates for a hoard of treasure stolen from an Egyptian Pharaoh's tomb by the legendary pirate ship, Neptune's Revenge, and its captain, Salty Ben. Tyler, Kirra, and Alison befriend a local Fijian tribe and its leader, Sol, who takes a liking to Kirra, while Marty preferes the pirate lifestyle, becoming Captain Blackheart's cabin boy at one stage. Marty's allegiance is constantly questioned whether he's on Blackheart's side or his brother Tyler's side, after Lily, leads a revolt and takes over Blackheart's ship. This is a problem for Marty, as Lily is crueller, more suspicious and far cleverer than Blackheart, who is more there for comedy than fast-paced action scenes.</p><p>Will Tyler, Kirra, and Alison find the three torn pieces of the treasure map and find their way home, or will the dreaded Captain Blackheart, Marty, Lily and the pirate crew find the Eye of Osiris, treasure of treasures, and live forever?</p>",

Cash opened each show, invariably preceding the first number with his customary \"Hello, I'm Johnny Cash\" greeting, and its regulars included members of his touring troupe, June Carter Cash (his wife) and the Carter Family, The Statler Brothers, Carl Perkins, and The Tennessee Three, with Australian-born musical director-arranger-conductor Bill Walker. The Statler Brothers performed brief comic interludes. An instrumental version of \"Folsom Prison Blues\" was used for the opening credits. It featured many folk-country musicians, such as Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan, Linda Ronstadt, Kris Kristofferson, Mickey Newbury, Neil Young, Gordon Lightfoot, Merle Haggard, James Taylor and Tammy Wynette. It also featured other musicians such as jazz great Louis Armstrong, who died eight months after appearing on the show.</p>",

However, generations passed and the colony forgot their purpose even as human knowledge of the race faded into mere legend. All that changes when the colony meets a boy with a Gummi Bear medallion which unlocks the Great Book of Gummi which reveals lost knowledge of their past. Now the colony has dedicated themselves to the new goal to rediscover their heritage with the help of a few trusted humans while preventing new enemies like Duke Igthorn from exploiting that heritage to their own ends.</p>",

The featured Muppets were Baby Kermit, Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo, Rowlf, Animal, Scooter, and a new character, Skeeter, Scooter's look-alike sister. Occasionally they had visits from Baby Bunsen and Beaker, and even Statler and Waldorf came to visit, and later we see a recurring appearance by a \"baby\" version of Bean Bunny from Tale of the Bunny Picnic. The moral glue that held these Muppets together was Nanny (voiced by Barbara Billingsley of Leave it to Beaver fame), a character whose body was only shown from the waist down and we all remember the green striped socks...</p>",

    "summary": "<p>The show focuses mainly on the life of junior high school student Ginger Foutley. She, along with her friends, Darren Patterson, Dodie Bishop and Macie Lightfoot, all try to rise from the position of school geeks as they solve many conflicts that come their way. Luckily for Ginger, the most popular girl in school, Courtney Gripling, has taken a liking to her and often includes her in her social plans. She is intrigued by her 'gingerisms', as Courtney calls them. However, Miranda Killgallen, Courtney's right hand woman, makes sure that she is not bumped down from her position thanks to Ginger. At home, Ginger records her lively adventures in her diary. Her little brother Carl, is often scheming with Robert-Joseph (\"Hoodsey\") Bishop in his own side plots, and her mother, Lois, is always there for advice Ginger is always open to listen to.</p>",

The Moligans were banished from the kingdom of Moleslavia by King Mole for various crimes including unlawful digging, mob action, robbery, looting and cheating. Since their banishment, the Moligans have been living underground and planning revenge against King Mole. Since the Moligans are short-sighted, they were unsuccessful in harvesting gold from the nearby mines. As such, the Moligans have attempted to enslave the Glo Friends to power their lanterns, which would enable them to see in the mines, harvest the gold and buy out the kingdom of Moleslavia.</p>",

The downside is that cartoons can cost even more than a live-action show, so in the case of Pac-Man, who really wasn't promoting anything besides a video game that everyone on the planet was already playing, just can't be thought of as a success.</p>",

    "summary": "<p><b>How</b> was a British educational television show created by Jack Hargreaves. It was produced from 22 March 1966 ΓÇô 19 August 1981.</p><p><i>How</i> was originally devised by Hargreaves for an audience of adults returning from the pub. Its aim would be to give facts and demonstrations that could settle arguments or be used aspub tricks. A one-off pilot was broadcast at 11.15pm on 22 March 1966, to viewers in the Southern Television area only.</p><p>Following the pilot, Hargreaves felt the show might work better in an afternoon slot, aimed at making facts fun for children. Thus, at 5.25pm on 25 April 1966, Southern began live transmission of the first programme in the series of <i>How</i>, which would continue in a similar format for the next fifteen years. Made in Southern's Southampton studios, it provided answers to questions beginning with the word \"How\".</p><p>Each episode began with the presenters all raising one hand and saying \"How\" simultaneously (mimicking the stereotypical Native American greeting). Topics commonly covered included science, history, mathematics and simple puzzles. The formula proved so successful that it was soon broadcast to the whole ITV network and given two slots per week.</p><p>The show was originally presented by Hargreaves alone. He was joined by Fred Dinenage (1966ΓÇô1981), Jon Miller (1966ΓÇô1981), Bunty James (1966ΓÇô1969 and 1970ΓÇô1976), Dr Tom Gaskell (1969), Jill Graham (1969ΓÇô1970) and Marian Davies (1977ΓÇô1981). Occasional stand-ins for Hargreaves included Barry Bucknell.</p><p>The series came to an end in 1981 when Southern Television lost its ITV franchise, but was revived as <i>How 2</i> in 1990.</p>",

At first, the Bugmin only cause small, bothersome things, but it will soon elevate into a global scale threat. Can one boy and one dog save the world?</p><p>(Source:ANN)</p>",

The original term and the accompanying language came during a meal Peyo was having with his colleague and friend André Franquin at the Belgian Coast. Having momentarily forgotten the word \"salt\", Peyo asked him (in French) to pass the schtroumpf. Franquin jokingly replied: \"Here's the Schtroumpf ΓÇö when you are done schtroumpfing, schtroumpf it back...\" and the two spent the rest of that weekend speaking in \"schtroumpf language\".

The next day, when he is called away from his surgery, robbers Oenk and Boenk steal the coffer. There must be something special about this gold, and the doctor decides to respond to the letter and search for its sender: the Duke of Wolf Castle. Does this duke really exist, or is he just a legendary character? Does he live in a castle, or in the old ruins on top of a ghostly rock?

They tell Yumi that flower fairies give magic tools to children who take care of flowers. Kakimaru and Keshimaru, which sees Yumi's pure affection towards flowers, decide to give her a magic cane and a pendant. By using the cane, any pictures she drew in the air takes form and becomes real. However, once the pendant starts to flash, there are only 30 seconds left before the power of the magic disappears. Yumi always tries to use her magical power in a good manner, but she is hasty and goofy. As a result, her magic often causes a big trouble around her. This is the fourth series of Magical Girl Series.</p>",

Together, they sought to con free meals and shelter especially out of the upper class, who in all honesty, presented little difficulty for the clever and mischievous birds. The synopses came from the Big Cartoon Database website. Deepest gratitude to whoever did these synopses! CAST: Heckle, magpie. Mischievous and witty, a tough bird with a Brooklyn accent. Jeckle, magpie. Heckle's twin who is also mischievous and witty, but is more refined and speaks with a British accent. Dimwit, hound.

The series follows the story of a young Xelan alien (Arjay Smith) who is stranded on Earth, and meets up with a young girl Robbie Stevenson (Erin J. Dean), her younger brother Josh (Shane Sweet), and their father Ken (Jack Tate). This family eventually adopts him, giving him the name \"Allen Strange\". He has extraordinary powers, including the ability to turn into his alien form, which allows him to hover. He uses his abilities to bring a mannequin in a sporting goods store to life; this \"animated mannequin\" poses as his Earth father, Manfred, for events like parent-teacher conferences. He also possesses extremely high intelligence and can read incredibly fast by simply placing his hand on the cover of a book. He has an affinity for canned cheese, and lives in the family's attic in a strange alien cocoon.</p>",

During the first season, all episodes ran in a two-hour marathon every Sunday. However, <i>Weinerville</i> quickly gained popularity: in the middle of the first season Nickelodeon began running the show on weekday afternoons. An addition to Weinerville's popularity Nickelodeon allowed Marc and his characters to host a New Years special event, a kid version of Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve \"Nick New Years\" which was intentionally host segments wrap around for the best Nicktoons and shows of that year, and read letters from kids about their New Year's resolutions as they count down to midnight, and celebrated by shooting slime into the sky. Marc and his Weinerville characters hosted \"Nick New Years\" in 1993 and 1994 from Times square in the Nickelodeon Party Penthouse. For the second season, which premiered on May 2, 1994, the episodes aired daily and in the summer was a part of the Stick Stickly show Nick in the Afternoon, which included Marc as Dottie in some segments. Unfortunately with all the success of hosting two seasons, promotions, three television specials, and hosting a four-hour new year's special for two years, Weinerville was not renewed for a third season. According to Marc, the cancellation of Weinerville happened was because Nickelodeon was changing their identity from family friendly to edgy, sarcastic, and some what subversive shows, and a puppetshow to Nickelodeon, did not fit in the networks' new direction of programming.</p>",

The characters, storylines, sounds and visual appeal of Pocoyo have been carefully researched to ensure that it is perfectly tailored to encourage child development. Pocoyo takes pre-school entertainment one step further - it is visually very different to any other pre-school programme. Its innovative use of CGI animation allows Pocoyo to become a very real child - he moves, talks, plays and learns like a toddler, and he can sulk and throw tantrums like only a toddler can!</p>",

Oh, and all of their schemes are conveyed through a series of jaunty hip-hop tunes (with those sections animated in the lo-fi style of a classic 8-bit videogame). It's charming and weird and brilliantly stylized, using a combination of real locations, 3D and 2D animation, and manipulated images. Truly, you will fall in love with Caclulord 3 and PX Micron, lively robots that will definitely conquer your heart.</p>",

In 1956 Gumby and his horse friend Pokey hit the airways on The Howdy Doody Show in their first shorts in 1956. It was so popular that it became its own show in 1957 called The Gumby Show. The show contained the 1956 shorts along with new ones. Each episode contained 3 cartoons. In the 1960's Goo the blue mermaid, Prickle the yellow dinosaur, and Nopey the dog were introduced. The Blockheads sometimes chased after Gumby, Pokey, Prickle, and Goo with some scheme. Gumbo and Gumba were Gumby's Dad and Mother. The show stopped in 1967 due to problems in Art Clokey's family and another cartoon. In the 1970's Gumby was totally ignored.

    "summary": "<p><b>Captain Kangaroo</b> is an American children's television series that aired weekday mornings on the American television network CBS for nearly 30 years, from October 3, 1955 until December 8, 1984, making it the longest-running nationally broadcast children's television program of its day. In 1986, the American Program Service (now American Public Television, Boston) integrated some newly produced segments into reruns of past episodes, distributing the newer version of the series until 1993. The show was conceived and the title character played by Bob Keeshan, who based the show on \"the warm relationship between grandparents and children\". Keeshan had portrayed the original Clarabell the Clown on The Howdy Doody Show when it aired on NBC. Captain Kangaroo had a loose structure, built around life in the \"Treasure House\" (later known as \"The Captain's Place\") where the Captain (the name \"kangaroo\" came from the big pockets in his coat) would tell stories, meet guests, and indulge in silly stunts with regular characters, both humans and puppets. Keeshan performed as Captain Kangaroo more than 9000 times over the nearly 30 year run of the show.</p><p>The show was telecast live to the East Coast and the Midwest for its first four years and broadcast on kinescope for the West Coast, as Keeshan would not perform the show live three times a day, and was in black-and-white until 1967. The May 17, 1971 episode saw two major changes on the show: The Treasure House was renovated and renamed \"The Captain's Place\" and the Captain replaced his navy blue coat with a red coat. In September 1981, CBS shortened the hour-long show to a half-hour, briefly retitled it \"Wake Up with the Captain\", and moved it to an earlier time slot; it was later moved to weekends in September 1982, and returned to an hour-long format. It was canceled by CBS at the end of 1984.</p>",

This allowed them to do such things as \"shrink\" the presenters to allow them to see life from an ant's viewpoint, or to swim in a riverbed for example. Dottie the ring-tailed lemur appeared as a regular guest for eight years in the 1970s. Much to Morris' anger, the show was discontinued in 1983 when the programme's anthropomorphic treatment of animals fell out of fashion.</p><p>The 100th edition was transmitted on 4 January 1967.</p>",

New Muppets are introduced throughout the series who would later appear in the newer Muppet films. The show itself gains a new host as Kermit the Frog passes the torch to a new Muppet named Clifford who hosts the show. In February 2004, Disney Enterprises bought two major Jim Henson properties: the Muppets and Bear in the Big Blue House. \"Muppets Tonight!\" premiered its first 10 episodes on ABC.
